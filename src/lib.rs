//! As Close As Possible â€” [nearest neighbor search] in Rust.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The notion of distances between points is captured by the [Proximity] trait.  Its [`distance()`]
//! method returns a [Distance], from which the actual numerical distance may be retrieved with
//! [`value()`].  These layers of abstraction allow `acap` to work with generically with different
//! distance functions over different types.
//!
//! There are no restrictions on the distances computed by a [Proximity].  For example, they don't
//! have to be symmetric, subadditive, or even positive.  Implementations that do have these
//! desirable properties will additionally implement the [Metric] marker trait.  This distinction
//! allows `acap` to support a wide variety of useful metric and non-metric distances.
//!
//! As a concrete example, consider `Euclidean<[i32; 2]>`.  The [Euclidean] wrapper equips any type
//! that has [coordinates] with the [Euclidean distance] function as its Proximity implementation:
//!
//!     use acap::distance::Proximity;
//!     use acap::euclid::Euclidean;
//!
//!     let a = Euclidean([3, 4]);
//!     let b = Euclidean([7, 7]);
//!     assert_eq!(a.distance(&b), 5);
//!
//! In this case, `distance()` doesn't return a number directly; as an optimization, it returns a
//! [EuclideanDistance] wrapper.  This wrapper stores the squared value of the distance, to avoid
//! computing square roots until absolutely necessary.  Still, it transparently supports comparisons
//! with numerical values:
//!
//!     # use acap::distance::Proximity;
//!     # use acap::euclid::Euclidean;
//!     # let a = Euclidean([3, 4]);
//!     # let b = Euclidean([7, 7]);
//!     use acap::distance::Distance;
//!
//!     let d = a.distance(&b);
//!     assert!(d > 4 && d < 6);
//!     assert_eq!(d, 5);
//!     assert_eq!(d.value(), 5.0f32);
//!
//! For finding the nearest neighbors to a point from a set of other points, the [NearestNeighbors]
//! trait provides a uniform interface to [many different similarity search data structures].  One
//! such structure is the [vantage-point tree], available in `acap` as [VpTree]:
//!
//!     # use acap::euclid::Euclidean;
//!     use acap::vp::VpTree;
//!     use acap::NearestNeighbors;
//!
//!     let tree = VpTree::balanced(vec![
//!         Euclidean([3, 4]),
//!         Euclidean([5, 12]),
//!         Euclidean([8, 15]),
//!         Euclidean([7, 24]),
//!     ]);
//!
//! [VpTree] implements [NearestNeighbors], which has a [`nearest()`] method that returns an
//! optional [Neighbor].  The [Neighbor] struct holds the actual neighbor it found, and the distance
//! it was from the target:
//!
//!     # use acap::euclid::Euclidean;
//!     # use acap::vp::VpTree;
//!     # use acap::NearestNeighbors;
//!     # let tree = VpTree::balanced(
//!     #     vec![Euclidean([3, 4]), Euclidean([5, 12]), Euclidean([8, 15]), Euclidean([7, 24])]
//!     # );
//!     let nearest = tree.nearest(&[7, 7]).unwrap();
//!     assert_eq!(nearest.item, &Euclidean([3, 4]));
//!     assert_eq!(nearest.distance, 5);
//!
//! [NearestNeighbors] also provides the [`nearest_within()`], [`k_nearest()`], and
//! [`k_nearest_within()`] methods which find up to `k` neighbors within a possible threshold.
//!
//! It can be expensive to compute nearest neighbors exactly, especially in high dimensions.
//! For performance reasons, [NearestNeighbors] implementations are allowed to return approximate
//! results.  Many implementations have a speed/accuracy tradeoff which can be tuned.  Those
//! implementations which always return exact results will also implement the [ExactNeighbors]
//! marker trait.  For example, a [VpTree] will be exact when the [Proximity] function is a
//! [Metric].
